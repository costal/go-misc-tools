A collection of tools for solving various problems, or optimizing and improving upon solved problems.

## Middler (v0.0.1)

middler is an experiment in http handling, with the hopes of progressing into a multifaceted http.Handler manager.
Currently considering whether or not to delve into the realm of multiplexing with this package. However, optimizing and perhaps retreading grounds for 
creative solutions might be where I'll find most of my endeavors here. 

## HTTPApp (v0.0.0)

Complementary to **middler**, HTTPApp acts as fulcrum for routing endpoints, multiplexing, and handling app models. Highly experimental, with purposeful weak optimization
as means of prototyping. The vision is to divest key areas - model handling aside - to separate models.
